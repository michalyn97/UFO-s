# UFO's

# Overview of Project
Dana has a passion for UFO's and would love to display the information of UFO sightings in her hometown from a data.js file that she received.   
We helped her create a dynamic web page with in depth insight on and filters.

# Results
We designed search options that allows you to filter through the data as well as a table that is organized in sections.   The data is easy to read and filtered by date, city, 
state, country, shape (of the UFO sighting) and comments.

# Summary
Dana is pleased with her web page; however, she may be able to improve the site by adding subpages that will allow users to comment on additional sightings they have seen 
recently.  
I would recommend updating the site that would include links to reference pages of other UFO sightings as well include images of the sightings.
